applies_if: summary.total_planned > 0
rationale: Explain variance into price/mix/volume effects (if columns exist).
steps:
- Create baseline using planned price and mix.
- Isolate price effect (actual price vs baseline price) if unit data present.
- Isolate mix effect by product/category share changes.
- Isolate volume effect by unit quantity delta.
