title: Utilization Uplift & Cost Absorption
applies_if: summary.avg_utilization is not None and summary.avg_utilization < 0.68
rationale: Low utilization hurts fixed cost absorption.
steps:
- Map fixed vs variable costs by line/site.
- Simulate +10% load to estimate margin recapture.
- Recommend load shift or temporary cost control.
expected_outcome: Improved utilization and margin absorption.
